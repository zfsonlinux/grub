        how memtest86+ is displayed.
      - Use UUIDs where appropriate.

  * Append .diff to patches/01_uuids_and_lvm_dont_play_along_nicely so

  * Drop completely the build dependency on gcc-multilib.
  * Instead of arborting in the preinst if /etc/kernel-img.conf still
    contains /sbin/update-grub, change the file with sed. Policy allows
    this because it's not a conffile.
  * Change /etc/default/grub to an ucf managed file instead of dpkg
