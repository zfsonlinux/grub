      in single user mode.
    - Add 04_convert_root_uuid.diff to default to using UUIDs
      on new GRUB2 installations.  (LP: #192956)

grub2 (1.95+20070515-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New CVS snapshot.
    - Fix assumptions about /, /boot and /boot/grub being the same device.
    (Closes: #423268, #422459)
    - Proper sorting of Linux images.  (Closes: #422580)
    - update-grub lets /etc/default/grub override its variables now.
    (Closes: #423649)
    - update-grub mentions /etc/default/grub in the grub.cfg header.
    (Closes: #423651)
    - update-grub sets 800x600x16 as the default gfxmode.  (Closes: #422794)
    - update-grub runs grub-mkdevicemap before attempting to use grub-probe
    (part of #423217)

  [ Otavio Salvador ]
  * Add support to DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt. Thanks to Sam Morris
    <sam@robots.org.uk> for the patch. (Closes: #423005)
  * Add Robert Millan as uploader.
  * Change build-dependency from liblzo-dev to liblzo2-dev. (Closes: #423358)

  [ Robert Millan ]
  * grub-pc.postinst:
    - Remove /boot/grub/device.map before running grub-install.
      (Closes: #422851)
    - Always run update-grub after grub-install. (part of #423217)
    - Use grub-mkdevicemap instead of removing device.map, since update-grub
      needs it but grub-install is not run unconditionaly.
    - Redirect grub-install invocation to /dev/null, since it can mislead
      users into thinking that MBR was overwritten.  (part of #423217)
  * default/grub: Stop exporting the variables (update-grub does that now).
  * Misc EFI fixes, including new grub-install.
    - patches/efi.diff: New.
    - patches/grub_probe_for_everyone.diff: Move some bits to efi.diff.
    - grub-efi.install: Stop installing dummy grub-install.
    - grub-install: Remove.
  * grub-pc.postinst: Avoid generating core.img when menu.lst is not present,
    to avoid duplicated work (this is specialy important for d-i).  (part of
    #423217).
  * See multiple references above.  (Closes: #423217)
  * grub-{pc,efi,of}.{dirs,install}: Install presubj in the right directory
    to make it work again (oops).
  * Add reportbug script to gather debugging information.  (Closes: #423218)
    - script: New.
    - grub-{pc,efi,of}.install: Install it.
  * Install the reportbug scripts for grub2 too, since users might still use
    it for bugfiling.
    - grub2.dirs
    - grub2.install
  * Fix some lintian warnings.
    - control (grub2): Depend on debconf.
    - README.Debian.in: Fix mispell.
    - grub2.templates: Remove extra dot.

  * Move debian/update-grub to debian/legacy/update-grub otherwise the
