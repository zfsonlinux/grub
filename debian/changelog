    (Closes: #372186)

    - control (Build-Depends): Add libc6-dev-powerpc [ppc64].

  [ Otavio Salvador ]
  * 01_fix_amd64_building.patch: dropped since it now supports amd64
    native building.

    initramfs-tools changes it's bug too.

  * Fork update-grub from grub legacy, and tweak a few commands in output to
    make it work for grub2.
  * Update README.Debian.in with more recent (and easier) install instructions.

    even if they don't use the same path yet (but will likely do in the
    future, see #361929).
  * Get rid of control.in, which I introduced in 0.6+20040805-1 and turned out
    to be an endless source of problems (and forbidden by policy as well).
